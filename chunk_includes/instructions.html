  <p>This study is about an alien language called Pinglish. The experiment is split into two halves.</p>
  <p>In the first half, you'll be shown a set of pictures together with some Pinglish words describing the objects in each scene. 
    Once the words have disappeared from below each picture, the task is to click on the right Pinglish word used to describe either the left- or right-hand picture. 
    After every four questions, you'll see an extra task asking you to pick the Pinglish word for one of the pictures you've seen so far.</p>
  <p>Your score will be displayed at the top-left corner of this window: you get 1 point when your first answer is correct.</p>
  <!-- <p>Answer accuracy will be used to determine if you paid attention. We reserve the right to modulate your compensation if your answer profile proves suspiciously low.</p> -->
  <p>In the second half of the experiment, you'll be tested on your knowledge of Pinglish from the first half, which will include applying your knowledge to new objects.</p>
  <p>Please do not write anything down during the experiment. We are interested in how you learn the language based on the training we give you.</p>
